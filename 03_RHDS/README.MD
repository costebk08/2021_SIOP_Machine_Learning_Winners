The script is designed to output a "model number" (based on date and the number of models run on a given date), 
with each run of the pre-processing and model building script components.
It is designed to be flexible so that the user can easily experiment with different parameters, and more parameters can be easily added.
The script will output all relevant files needed, including model evaluation files and parameters used.
Feel free to email me at costebk08@gmail.com if you have any questions about running the script.
